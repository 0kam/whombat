## 1. I'm having trouble logging in. What should I do?

If you're logging into Whombat for the first time, you might not have a
personalized username and password yet. Don't worry, Whombat automatically sets
up a default user during initialization.

To get started:

* Username: **admin**
* Password: **admin**

After your initial login, head over to your user profile to customize both your
username and password to something more personalized and secure.
