## Our Standards

At Whombat, we emphasize code quality and employ various tools to streamline development.

### Code Formatting

We follow the black style for Python to maintain consistent formatting throughout the project.
Additionally, we use isort to organize imports neatly.
For the Typescript project, prettier serves as the primary code formatter.

### Linting

We utilize the following tools for linting and error checking:

1. Python:

   - **Ruff** for fast overall error checking
   - **Pyright** for type checking

2. Typescript:
   - **Eslint** for linting
   - **Tsc** for checking Typescript code

### Documentation

We adhere to the Numpy docstring format for documenting Python code.
Our documentation is built using mkdocs, providing a clear and organized structure for users and contributors.
